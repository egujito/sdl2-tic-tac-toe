# sdl2-tic-tac-toe
Simple program I wrote to learn SDL2 and expand my C knowledge

_The drawing of the shapes is not beautiful at all and kinda messy._

Used external header: [`circle.h`](https://gist.github.com/Gumichan01/332c26f6197a432db91cc4327fcabb1c) to draw circles as SDL2 does not support it by default.
